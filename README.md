Admin Panel

Moving on to the admin panel, a system administrator has complete authority. An administrator has the authority to oversee the system’s correct operation. He or she has control over website settings, image sliders, products, orders, and customers, among other things. An admin can adjust header-footer settings, website brandings, and other website features when it comes to website settings.

Aside from that, an administrator can control image sliders, page settings, and service areas on the client side.

Product Management

It contains information such as the product’s name, categories, pricing, size, color, description, features, and photos. There are no such restrictions when it comes to uploading image files for each product. Finally, the system gives you the choice to highlight the product. Where the administrator may simply go to the highlighted product section and add it to the client-side as a featured product.

Order Management

This part, on the other hand, contains a list of all customer orders. The system displays order details, including customer and product information, as well as payment information, paid amount, and status. By default, all orders are placed in the pending status under shipment and payment status. Each order must be manually verified and the status of each order must be changed. An administrator must designate everything as complete as soon as it is received, from payment status to shipping status. In addition, the administrator can send customized messages to consumers, such as product-related difficulties or a simple thank you greeting. Because the results are dependent on the admin side of things, this part is linked to the customer’s order history. In addition, the user can remove orders and search for them by product name, client name, or pricing information.

Customer Management and Page Settings

Furthermore, after joining up, each consumer must authenticate their account. Additionally, all validated client accounts are listed in the admin panel’s customer area.
